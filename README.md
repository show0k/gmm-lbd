# GMM-lbd
Gaussian mixture experiments for learning by demonstration

## Roadmap
### Low level (Gaussian micture)
* [X] Automaticly choose the number of gaussians
* [x] conditional probability of GMM
* [x] regression of GMM
* [X] produit of retrived means and covariances of GMMs
* [ ] speed management 

### High level (combinaison of movements)
* [X] Quick add pypot records for any motors
* [X] Easyly represent GMM with ellipses
* [ ] Plot ellipse for GMM with more than 2 dimensions
* [ ] Align movements with DTW  
* [ ] White detection (at begin and end of movements)
* [ ] Sequential : concatenation of GMMs
* [ ] Concurent : product 
* [ ] Add a coefficiant to rise or low the importance of a movement
* [ ] Add a filter in the sequential combinaison
